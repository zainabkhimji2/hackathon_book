Generate measurable, actionable learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy for technical educational content.

WHAT IT DOES:
Creates specific learning outcomes that define what students will be able to DO after completing a lesson/module. Uses action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy (Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create).

FORMAT:
"By the end of this [lesson/week/module], students will be able to:
- [Action verb] + [specific skill/knowledge] + [context/condition]"

EXAMPLES:
- "Implement a ROS 2 publisher-subscriber node in Python with proper error handling"
- "Analyze URDF files to identify kinematic chains and joint constraints"
- "Design a navigation stack for a mobile robot using Nav2 and SLAM"

USE FOR: Planning lessons, designing assessments, creating course overviews, measuring learning outcomes.
