Break complex technical concepts into progressive, manageable learning steps with logical dependencies.

WHAT IT DOES:
Decomposes difficult topics into a learning sequence that builds from simple to complex. Identifies prerequisites, creates step-by-step progression, ensures each step is teachable.

APPROACH:
1. Identify the end goal (complex concept)
2. Work backwards to find prerequisites
3. Create 4-7 progressive steps
4. Ensure each step is concrete and testable
5. Note cognitive load at each step

EXAMPLE (Humanoid Locomotion):
Step 1: Basic kinematics (forward/inverse)
Step 2: Center of mass calculation
Step 3: Zero Moment Point (ZMP) concept
Step 4: Static stability vs dynamic stability
Step 5: Gait generation basics
Step 6: Balance control loops
Step 7: Disturbance rejection

USE FOR: Structuring difficult topics, planning lesson sequences, designing progressive exercises.
