# Week 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI

## Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sets the stage for understanding how AI is applied in real-world robotic systems. We will explore the core differences between Physical AI and its digital counterpart, delve into the principles of embodied intelligence, and examine the critical role of sensor systems in enabling robots to perceive and interact with their environment. The chapter also covers the unique challenges and constraints inherent in developing intelligent physical systems, including safety, real-time processing, and the sim-to-real gap.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

*   Define Physical AI and distinguish it from Digital AI.
*   Explain the concept of embodied intelligence and its significance in robotics.
*   Identify common sensor systems used in robotics (LIDAR, cameras, IMU) and understand their basic principles.
*   Analyze the perception-action loop in robotic systems.
*   Discuss the key challenges and constraints in designing and implementing Physical AI.
*   Appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI, integrating aspects of computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering.

## Estimated Time

This chapter is designed to be covered over approximately **2 weeks**, assuming 10-15 hours of study per week. This includes time for reading, reviewing diagrams, completing exercises, and engaging in supplementary research.
