# Week 3: ROS 2 Part 1 - Fundamentals\n\n## Chapter Overview\n\nWelcome to the world of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)! This chapter is your entry point into understanding and utilizing the powerful middleware framework that is foundational for modern robotics development. We will begin by exploring the core architecture of ROS 2, comparing it to its predecessor (ROS 1) and highlighting the key advancements in areas like distributed data management (DDS). You will then dive into the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 nodes and topics, learning how to build a basic publisher-subscriber system in Python. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to create, build, and run your first ROS 2 Python node, laying a solid groundwork for more complex robotic applications.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nBy the end of this chapter, you will be able to:\n\n*   **Explain** the core architecture of ROS 2, including the role of DDS.\n*   **Differentiate** between ROS 1 and ROS 2, identifying key improvements.\n*   **Understand** the concepts of ROS 2 nodes, topics, and the publisher-subscriber communication pattern.\n*   **Implement** a simple ROS 2 publisher and subscriber in Python.\n*   **Create** a ROS 2 workspace and package structure.\n*   **Build** and **run** your first ROS 2 Python node.\n*   **Utilize** basic ROS 2 command-line tools for introspection.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nTo get the most out of this chapter, you should have:\n\n*   **Python Basics**: Intermediate proficiency in Python programming (variables, loops, functions, classes, basic file I/O).\n*   **Linux Familiarity**: Basic comfort with the Linux command line (navigating directories, running commands, editing text files). ROS 2 is primarily developed and deployed on Linux environments (Ubuntu recommended).\n*   **Prior Knowledge (Optional but Recommended)**: Completion of "Week 1-2: Introduction to Physical AI" will provide valuable context on embodied intelligence and robotic sensing.\n
