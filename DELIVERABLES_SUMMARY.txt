================================================================================

CONCEPT-TO-IMPLEMENTATION MAPPING

  Week 1-2 Concept              →  Week 3-4 ROS 2 Implementation
  ──────────────────────────────   ────────────────────────────
  Perception-action loops       →  ROS 2 node graphs with pub/sub
  Multi-rate systems            →  Different node frequencies
  Sensor fusion                 →  Fusion nodes combining streams
  Latency budgets               →  Real-time scheduling
  Safety mechanisms             →  Watchdog and monitoring nodes
  System architecture           →  Launch files and configuration

TERMINOLOGY PRE-LEARNING
  Students encounter naturally:
  • Node (software component)
  • Topic (data stream)
  • Service (request-response)
  • Launch file (configuration)
  • Real-time scheduling (timing guarantees)

DESIGN METHODOLOGY
  Students learn transferable decision framework:
  1. Understand requirements (constraints, goals)
  2. Identify decision dimensions
  3. Enumerate options
  4. Create comparison matrices
  5. Justify selections
  6. Identify failure modes
  7. Plan mitigation strategies
